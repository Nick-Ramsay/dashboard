This is a simple website that I use to see information useful to me and practice coding. JavaScript is utilized for the dropdown menu and the times listed on the left while the body of the page itself utilises feeds showing US stock prices, a newsfeed with US news specific to my northeastern United States, and exchange rates which I find useful as an American expat living in Australia.
